# Ubuntu Automation

## About 
Scripts that can be used to automate repetitive tasks when setting up servers
or performing automation tasks. 

----

## System Requirements
All scripts have been tested and are confirmed to work on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Server Edition. Running these scripts on any other OS may result in unexpected
results as the code has not been tested on these systems.

### VirtualBox
Any Unix or Linux based system with Oracle VirutalBox installed. Code has been 
tested and confirmed to be working with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using Oracle 
VirtualBox 5.

----

## Installing
- Pull the latest version of the code from the repository. 

### VirtualBox
On your local machine, copy config.example.sh to config.sh. Confirm that the 
paths in the config.sh file do exist on your local machine. If they do not, 
then update the paths in config.sh or create the necessary folders. The files 
will be automatically created and removed each time the script runs.

---- 

## Running Scripts
To run the script, just call the script via the command line. If a script requires
an argument to be passed, the script will display the values to be passed.
