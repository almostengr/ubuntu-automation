# Ubuntu Automation and Scripts

## About 

Scripts that can be used to automate repetitive tasks when setting up servers, 
desktops, performing periodic maintenance, or performing automation tasks. 

Some of the scripts here are used on and for my YouTube Channel. An 
Ubuntu video playlist has been created that demonstrates some of the scripts 
that are part of this repository. You can watch the playlist by visiting
